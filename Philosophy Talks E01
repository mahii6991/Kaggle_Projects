harmless is google and negative explanation for everything know yeah you can't explain soand on the human experiences know why thing i added daytona languages yeah that's your will do you know what's gone you may know and i'm now they on justify what i think is that there is no language for explaining certain thing language in a sense you know there are things you know languages better if you wantthe get your remote and if you want to sawyer said saddam answer lake area they more sense of your human existence when you when it comes so explaining something which it out of your bone and sometimes it out not under your control and something sweet as sort of ah nd damage money or or or like hyper damageand meeting the like you are not experiencing that in this particular well but you'd think that sort of those things are like coming out of from out the well i think did something which is the best thing is that feeling and that feeling depends on person to person like every person feels that team differently and the tinker then minute company get thosefeelings without any language and without any system those feelings are not communicated in the right from a way that it should be communicated via rather than it is of abd in two different things in order to make it extremely well and then those those those explainable thingsbasically yacht lose loses its meaning and lately it it becomes really is you know if you want to achieve something like things that are very underrated in western like society western culture they talk a lot that thing that communication is that he you know it's like the central part of everything know yeah if you gothe to the with some with a person with wisdom that life people speak few words yeahthough bullet at a few want to know something an adopt silence you have a gay you can't it's quite know about knowledge ideas the league you are you know this same thing yeah okay you are exploding but with the experience and the thing is good you who money hello be the thing with evolution you bought good and you can'tcompared them to do those shootings i would say this eyeballing money how it was nearly one in my world will inexperience yeah the fall and how can you compare things going on less than they need to a woman things good they need to shut up and focus on experiences yeah they're just doing you know no doubt they're doing great things in time to be they're creating yeahor likealthough machineries all the things do that did it which is not a thing now i'll be i'll nibble another think it works for think you will be cocky is a key be without at theso how you have how can you tell their own give you an example of the difference gameif ithere are two people one is from you know that fit from that lists yeah because coalinga okay you have to go from here the to india yeahgo without using any meanif someone has experienced hosting they really read did without any means that only that plan gone anything yeah if you to lead up to arrest him he will be an award me like without being a lobby up with a mask and then he was really yeah they will not think younger good that's alone with those things in your name would you plan to human didthis and that know yeah there's so much you know human soul why it is like you know it is something that you can't comprehend know joe be a hobby heck board legal but ah the against central park which is not yeah central part is your mind and your soul yeah is way bigger than that exactly how can they be a hobby of census getsinegal is that the why not everything revolver around they can be do like if you see more than joby children trends yeah where is it all along and know there's only a body and everything is and looking around word body like i and those tanks are basically their luggage to highlight a heightened senses isso sensible not order sensible thing not yet i'm a leg or is just do it for you to stay in this realm and a history as the things around here yeahand though there is no focus on that experience you know and when i've had that experience that experience mean when ah you communicate by switching off your senses and then you realize okay they called the things work in and around night is that is something languages doneand in in ancient lose and or in ancient tradition is business in this on radio ah focuses on different things are defender really do you make that connection you make that ah channeling of your anymore and rightin order to understand those things by trying to control your senses and then experiencing the life as it is like if i'm act of i'm trying to explain a parakeet and yeah so the thing is given the problem that is good then you know like in like this so much you know they have adissected the human body everything and on the have opened it in a way they're trying to make the thing that they are searching for it doesn't exist dinnermuddy and formit's something bigger than that exactly yeah and that is their problem you know yeah and the the time to everythingi would tell you like i told you the mid on to allow do up your the whole the africa he blamed and it is a very of those import will do it is believed either one person who hasthere were nine million give him and and the it'll be a bipolar the if i did you let you don't you can't read or do and new don't understand know yeah but i will try to find that looksin english but if they have been studied to judges and i do mainly as of the that sensibilities dinner with the wrist do maybe it's search the it on those things though i found a book with me he the physician and not a physician for this is open says dia yeah like to focus on mother we had not famous nothingbut the would have a good and become good me the any other dorm a he has spoken in terms of godmother a lot cook a references to understand he looked he is when renounces go either neutral liquor though the thing is good have one on this a be dimension manner know some inventions near he can go defenselesstelephone of that is a to idea let's may have they can givethe thing is give a hobby than i'm too long a klingon again if you compare it to do the a be movies manuscriptwhat is when they like one thousand two told the news bulletin going to the will will go to my experience but you can yeah well okay i'm in be bought in he game because you can't yeah you can do it near souli don't think get there will be like thousand five hundred be willing around on on on the west who has experienced some level of you know that lucky younger head that i do you know you're certain and war with to have any like you know liketiny things to do to achieve those we did not possible they all will will do something the wrong with you if we go the gone did have lack of faith and and fifty the broader dumb again not in the lead and you don't have god or something that is something else yeah had themohbut if you go to the eastern you knowlike region you would find so many people who has experienced yeah yeah and it is not just one like we know like you know we know like an unfit five hundred people are done not even that not get the law can do together there's so many be familiar with was still lid new experiences they really bonded because these things you know when you likeimagine you explore the universedo you really like there will be humans who can you know go to like they can explore the universe that industrial me adding this their existing hear what they are not bound by diamonds for than that is i believe in that that is what i i think i was not something that you can if i go and said this the i have been you know may you guessit have wednesdayyeah and for them is not lying some of them that they had that power and they can take their body they can toss will he is equally and to get distributor you will get a new people who have literally experience it yeahmalone good he will experience a it's not like you know some an equation so there are people who have that much you know mother was never going to build it again they can talk on their body and though some leg at doesn't want a hike with a or don't give up ago really good get the the yeahso it always the same same don't i did i don't know why not one thing the will get our daily your daughter biography of a yogi and it has the same and say then let their the showcase has basically don't get grow to you know ah general bogan okay an autobiography of are you can get a good old like he used for going to get like two different things it does hehim down to two different people likebasically he used to be present in two different location at the same time and communicating defendingnow all the question arises if you know whatever you are studying or his face when it is it is something like really i to mean that whatever you are studying from the kindergarten of from from the nursery or from from when you are a small childwhy is everything talk to youdoesn't make any sense you know when you're growing your new start to portion goes yang zing it you understand that these things are notthat they they should have taught you in that particular way rather than you are does being are bugged him to teaching these aid like learning these things and the our understanding these things with this about a specific lens and a specific shame that nesbitt fake thinking that you have to are basically go to these daysstages of life and you have to do this and that and then i'll be really does is like your whole life is mapped out when you start your schooling in like many is calling in the nursery and you know ultimately you bro anyone think and you understand is different aspect of ahthese are no faith and philosophy is as you grow up and then you'd think you'll get these things are not the way that you have god for from values of when it as you were a child because you know the first thing that the teachers years mathematics yeah and if you'd talk about the human experience i mean amendmentex is one of the most important part of it but the game by the lateyou know a girl if you look at the he does and defend the ancient philosophies and ancient written textthe mathematics was much more developed in the east then in the west no doubt the have devil of now much in i'm in a month while you should be but thethe thing is that that you have not got those things faneuil delegates i think you will have of a completely different perspective if you are not being has sold through this process annual italian a so the thing you know why that's happening it's because there is a must for theyou know mass production of them is that you want to you know this dig anywhere near the every will have a good education system in that instance yeah like though that so called regret that we're so fascinated by a new eating that you know that can be that dogs were the great month yeah that's not fair you see that damn mathematician like who howthat happenyes let that happen leah la montage i'm now my degree or another problem give real you know so fascinated by piece of paperthat we're getting from the university and then we that will be of know there's not a

does he know the thing is gayif he was like you know that is this real said gender or like another will be contemporary says ideagive we're so fucked up by the small experiences like we want you know we we we have shell experienceswe have shell experiences we are you know like we're running up the small thingswe're running off the small things to thing that will have something big but the whole new he lived johanna john and will buy that they're making sense of things you know me i will go there are no it's not the thing that are not how it works yeaheverything that you need is inside youyeah it is inside you yeah you don't have to look anywhere you just have to look inside that is very simple wouldyou know yeah and it's not on is not a month like a small statement it is a very big thing if you and isn't so you have like imprint of all these things like the you knew what it did inside you you just have to look at ituplike if we see himwe written in that swami rickman the as a good good good let him go today i will that be dealt with the who donald could a little with be know about now give nothing he has got those experiences he has done all that work yeah and you see like heath like his lifethe ramakrishna lifeyeahlikeoh he did things like he experiencedthat will thenchristianity islam you never know and the thing is would humble again this is a thing that we're seeing the only it said to experience ski near on key like it navy around sixty as it was a huge me yeahno experience and then i'm experience give up and this is a where the interesting thing that is a big distance between the gamesee a soda like up you know a carrier and soall these to like you have been on the your soul is that it can earn travel like thousand million times faster than anything little speed of light whatever do we and not be was first the same thing you can't even comparethe thing is body the problem in here because getting that it stops us know it's not truethe thing is urgent up the lifespan with the people who have done too many things in this such spin and you're not being able to rule one thing now where's the problem they have got them time somebody with the difference yeahof mind yeah we have dublinlike if there are some problems with the brand but you know they will be will use and but you know you can't say that uganda indoor things why because we're just you know focusing on small things the thing is more you work on your experienceswhen you start losing the impurities from your soul get off moving faster yeah and that's how they label to do those great big things it's not nothing you know that you gone did you you under smoking the wrong direction that's the simple thing my why because this system that created like this time we are justfocusing on you know that like everything that you can get his phonelike money not near a wedding i think like okay i'll gowe go to kamali and then i'll be know there there are you know sitting in one place and they were traveling all along the word man this me on the field the of those look at that happen and the gun you understand getting you and in get whole those people had that much wisdom without even getting out of that one village near thebut what i get this body needs to be an all we need more did experiences solely something different so we're trying to problem is we are you seeing them as the same thingrouting than our body experiences will be no it's not like that yeah you can use one works in a different way of one why he once in a defendant is two different things yeah and we're given this body to experience certain things now and that do the were you know that is not a blessing that is a best all the senses andnot a blessing to us the that a test so you have to why they go for it like fasting and onthen his body gets walk with at the gossipy the will allow will cotillard the guy rather than that are over they just let it go yeah the don't get amount of but what in from there you don't they start yeah i'm gatheringso that is a problem this whole a be a the hung in western world were honest and millionaire not really have to go yeah from of things like you know it looks cool yeah you have that body looks new look cool yeah you that is the problem you know how money to a basic approach him the thought he he'll school as i had a phobia and we gandhi when you know orrenton this is like an old jokea good and when you start working on yourself and then you go into them to get up your mind and you know how it is fucked the by only a systemyou'll be like know what i have done to myselfnot as a last thing is why they go to and because they're you start that thing and hung up any we want you know we just want to have that is not yeah the thing that this society if you like ma'am on the gonggrijp than rperm aor my listen to what that everything bottle that the this but relativelythis this this this this new altogether and google play gamesthere used to shit all the dick from of naval on can escape the in am and jonathan then these kind of people you know older i don't take them and like in good scientific would you handle that already even just won't be will learn things now on the take a bullet younger knowledge of a daily the don't give you anything because it just comesnugget it had not done the know your mouth off limits below the now put us government if you see that going you be done he has a bind with it on and i'll step i'll count every step make a hobby looking what is a point night the wanna walk away though the thing like mutton a hobby to got contradiction than we humbly it up and got conflict the and like you are deadadding this thing you on swung than this direction and then you are using wrong day earth information yeah why are you not giving them the law that is their the dominik was devised the other self be thoughwith they were himletting him with your game like widow and i got there like from saudi arabia and us all the libya or that infant the western will yeah what long will it funny but they're ready much fucked up in that thingdoor that sect of which i was lookingon global glia would you put a problem that bob walaker the the but when i didn't i didn't you have anything minute good seeing as geek i was studying psychology manga guy will western dismount like the thought was time to some way obvious lol mediocre based on whiny no no one is there are some with western long or my local donor typing of in in on thatcheck on get what to do it when we no one talks about and beagle leaned don't give a fuck about a beacon new and the problem was why you have this information you have to go to this and this place so how does a little eatingyeah and that is a problem that we're doing we want something else and we're taking will doesn't even know yeah exactly angle between means with a lot of the and then we like logo didn't area right no find food or problem for a total times and then taking advice taking advice from another thought or inventing a god we got and when you think that we owed on people have nohum it mobile nail cooli'm good numbers may be like when i see no good people again be beloved okaybobbing and doing the that in the difference you know you can be cool you can create so much content you can buy books but is gonna do and it's like the stupid information and then up next open and would go thoughi would never written you know someone like bill or be sent him a double click then they're like to get their of scientifically correct but not practically than nothingwhy because they like does not define no don't have experiences knowlynette created business in the longbow thing and then they're selling them with them likethe have their this came via the saying that they are selling and xps within not don't knowno one percent different experience like that knowand that's the problemgay sirlet's hit upon cost per
